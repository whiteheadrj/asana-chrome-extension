# Progress: links

## Original Goal

Create a tabbed UI. The default tab is our existing UI. The second tab will be a history of tasks created with the title we used and a link to those tasks, that will open Asana to the task.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Research phase complete - research.md created
- [x] Requirements phase complete - requirements.md created
- [x] Design phase complete - design.md created
- [x] Tasks phase complete - tasks.md created (21 tasks across 4 phases)
- [x] 1.1 Add TaskHistoryEntry type - c684f9f
- [x] 1.2 Add TASK_HISTORY storage key - 6feb741
- [x] 1.3 Create history.ts module with storage functions - 9a575bc
- [x] 1.4 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint - PASS (no fixes needed)
- [x] 1.5 Add formatRelativeTime to history.ts - 1e25d2a
- [x] 1.6 Add renderHistoryList to history.ts - c511cd2
- [x] 1.7 Add tab bar and history panel to popup.html - e8b53be
- [x] 1.8 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint - PASS (no fixes needed)
- [x] 1.9 Add tab and history CSS styles - 6dd2ad3

Task 1.10 Add tab switching logic to popup.ts

## Learnings

### Verification: 1.4 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint
- Status: PASS
- Commands: pnpm lint (exit 0), pnpm check-types (exit 0)
- Duration: ~3s
- No fixes needed

- Asana API already returns `permalink_url` in task creation response - no URL construction needed
- Current popup already displays permalink in success state (popup.ts:1191)
- Storage patterns well-established via `get<T>`/`set<T>` in shared/storage.ts
- STORAGE_KEYS enum pattern should be extended with `TASK_HISTORY`
- Popup width fixed at 380px - history list must be compact
- chrome.storage.local persists across browser restarts, cleared on extension removal
- Storage limit: 10MB default, plenty for task history
- JSON-serializable only: dates must be stored as ISO strings or timestamps
- Tab UI can be implemented with pure CSS + minimal JS, matching existing vanilla patterns
- No external framework dependencies - keep it vanilla
- AsanaTask type already exists in types.ts with gid, name, permalink_url
- Priority: Speed of delivery - MVP first, iterate later
- P1 items (clear history, tab persistence) deferred to post-MVP
- 50 entry cap keeps storage under 50KB even with long task names
- History save should happen in popup.ts success handler after saveLastUsedSelections()
- Separate history.ts module keeps concerns clean; popup.ts orchestrates
- Event delegation pattern already used in popup.ts for tag removal - reuse for history clicks
- showSection() pattern can be adapted for tab panel switching
- ARIA roles needed: tablist, tab, tabpanel for accessibility
- Lazy load history on first History tab click for performance
- No virtual scrolling needed - 50 items max renders fast
- Task Planning: POC checkpoint (1.14) requires manual E2E validation due to Chrome extension auth limitations
- Task Planning: E2E tests can verify built artifacts but full flow needs manual testing
- Task Planning: success-section should remain outside tab panels (shared across tabs)
- Task Planning: historyLoaded flag prevents redundant storage reads on tab switches
- Task Planning: Reset historyLoaded on task creation so next History visit shows new entry
- Task Planning: Use textContent (not innerHTML) for task names to prevent XSS

## Blockers

- None currently

## Next

User approves tasks, then proceed to implementation (Phase 1: POC)
