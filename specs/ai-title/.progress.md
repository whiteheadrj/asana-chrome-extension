# Progress: ai-title

## Original Goal

Currently we are using AI to suggest the title of the task. It is not very useful. We need to take into consideration the email subject and contents of the email to recommend the title. If it is just a web page use the page contents for title recommendation.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Research phase complete - research.md created
- [x] Requirements phase complete - requirements.md created
- [x] Design phase complete - design.md created
- [x] 1.1 Extend AIInput type with new fields
- [x] 1.2 Extend GmailEmailInfo type
- [x] 1.3 Extend OutlookEmailInfo type
- [x] 1.4 Add getEmailBody() to Gmail content script
- [x] 1.5 Add getEmailSender() to Gmail content script
- [x] 1.6 Update Gmail message listener to include new fields
- [x] 1.7 Add getEmailBody() to Outlook content script
- [x] 1.8 Enhance getSenderInfo() in Outlook content script - 7fac331
- [x] 1.9 Update Outlook message listener to include new fields
- [x] 1.10 Fix pageTitle bug in popup
- [x] 1.11 Add state fields for new email data
- [x] 1.12 Update requestPageInfo() to capture new fields
- [x] 1.13 Add page content extraction for non-email pages
- [x] 1.14 Update generateAiSuggestion() to pass new data to AI
- [x] V3 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: popup changes
- [x] 1.15 Improve SYSTEM_PROMPT for action-oriented titles
- [x] 1.16 Update buildUserPrompt() for new fields

## Learnings

### Task 1.16: buildUserPrompt() update
- Created truncate() helper for consistent text truncation
- Priority order implemented: selectedText (500) > emailSubject > emailSender > emailBody (1000) > pageTitle (100) > pageContent (2000)
- pageContent only included when contentType === 'webpage'
- pageTitle skipped when equals emailSubject to avoid duplication
- selectedText labeled as "primary" to indicate user intent signal

### Verification: V3 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: popup changes
- Status: PASS
- Commands: pnpm check-types (0), pnpm lint (0)
- Duration: ~2s
- All popup changes compile cleanly with no type or lint errors

### Verification: V2 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: Outlook changes
- Status: PASS
- Commands: pnpm check-types (0), pnpm lint (0)
- Duration: ~2s
- All Outlook content script changes compile cleanly

### Verification: V1 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: types and Gmail changes
- Status: PASS
- Commands: pnpm check-types (0), pnpm lint (0)
- Duration: ~3s
- All type definitions and Gmail content script changes compile cleanly

- Current AI title generation only uses `pageTitle`, `selectedText`, `emailSubject`, `pageUrl` - missing email body content
- Gmail content script already extracts subject via DOM selectors but not email body
- Outlook content script extracts subject but not email body
- Bug found: popup uses `document.title` which is popup's title, not page title
- AIInput type needs extension with `emailBody`, `emailSender`, `pageContent`, `contentType`
- Best practice: XML-structured prompts work well with Claude
- Best practice: Put source text ABOVE prompt (recency effect)
- Best practice: Start task titles with action verbs (Review, Follow up, Schedule)
- Best practice: Preserve specifics (names, dates, invoice numbers) in titles
- Token budget consideration: Email bodies should be truncated to ~1000 chars
- DOM selectors for email body extraction may need maintenance as Gmail/Outlook update their UIs
- Haiku model is adequate but larger prompts = slower/costlier calls
- Requirements: Selected text should take priority when present (user intent signal)
- Requirements: Graceful degradation at every extraction point is critical
- Requirements: contentType discrimination helps prompt select appropriate extraction strategy
- Requirements: Edge case handling needed for confidential emails, empty bodies, multi-language
- Requirements: Success criteria should include action verb presence rate
- Design: Use chrome.scripting.executeScript for page content extraction to avoid new content scripts
- Design: Outlook already has getSenderInfo() - enhance with fallback selectors rather than rewrite
- Design: Gmail body selectors: .a3s.aiL, [data-message-id] .ii.gt, .adn.ads
- Design: Outlook body selectors: [data-app-section="ConversationReadingPane"], .XbIp4.jmmB7.GNqVo
- Design: Plain text prompt works better than XML for this use case with Haiku
- Design: 15 implementation steps identified, mostly modifications to existing files

## Blockers

- None currently

## Next

Task 1.17: Update confidence calculation for new inputs

## Task Planning Insights

- 32 total tasks: 18 POC, 3 refactoring, 7 testing, 4 quality gates
- 8 [VERIFY] checkpoints distributed throughout all phases
- POC phase is self-contained: types first, then Gmail, then Outlook, then popup, then AI module
- E2E tests may require additional Playwright/Puppeteer setup for Chrome extension testing
- Integration tests can mock chrome.* APIs using existing patterns from service-worker.integration.test.ts
- All tasks have automated verification commands - no manual testing required
- DOM selector risk mitigated by multiple fallback selectors and debug logging
