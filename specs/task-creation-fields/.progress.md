# Progress: task-creation-fields

## Original Goal

I want the ability to set the assignee, but to have the option to have it be blank as well. Include this field in the defaulting logic.

I want the ability to set the due date, but have the ability for it to be blank.

In the note, if it is from an email include the following information if available: sender name, sender email, date received, subject, email account that received it.

Also if it is an email include a search string I can use in the appropriate email client: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-search-in-outlook-d824d1e9-a255-4c8a-8553-276fb895a8da or https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid

## Learnings

### Verification: 1.8 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: content scripts
- Status: PASS
- Commands: pnpm lint (exit 0), pnpm check-types (exit 0)
- No fixes needed - all checks passed on first run

### Research Phase Discoveries

- **Asana API supports both fields**: `assignee` (user GID), `due_on` (YYYY-MM-DD date)
- **Users endpoint available**: `GET /workspaces/{workspace_gid}/users` returns users in workspace
- **Email date NOT extracted**: Neither Gmail nor Outlook content scripts currently extract received date
- **Sender extraction needs enhancement**: Currently returns name OR email, need both separately
- **Gmail search syntax**: `from:email subject:"text" after:YYYY/MM/DD before:YYYY/MM/DD`
- **Outlook search syntax**: `from:"email" subject:"text" received:M/D/YYYY`
- **Defaulting pattern exists**: LastUsedSelections stores workspace, project, section - extend for assignee
- **Note generation pattern exists**: noteParts array joined with `\n\n` in popup.ts

### Requirements Phase Discoveries

- **Sender extraction split needed**: Gmail uses `span.gD` with both textContent (name) and `email` attribute - need to return both
- **Outlook sender format**: Returns "Name<email@domain.com>" - need to parse both parts
- **Due date defaulting NOT requested**: User wants assignee to persist, but due date can reset to blank each session
- **Account email Outlook gap**: Outlook content script doesn't extract receiving account email (Gmail does)
- **Search string date formats differ**: Gmail uses `YYYY/MM/DD`, Outlook uses `M/D/YYYY` (no leading zeros)

### Quality Commands

- Lint: `pnpm lint`
- TypeCheck: `pnpm check-types`
- Test: `pnpm test`
- E2E: `pnpm test:e2e`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Local CI: `pnpm lint && pnpm check-types && pnpm test && pnpm build`

### Key Implementation Gaps Identified

1. `getEmailDate()` function missing from both content scripts
2. Sender name vs email not separated - need both for search strings
3. No `getUsers()` API function in asana-api.ts
4. No user caching pattern (similar to projects/tags)
5. CreateTaskPayload missing `assignee` and `due_on` fields
6. LastUsedSelections missing `assigneeGid` field
7. Popup UI missing assignee dropdown and due date input

## Blockers

None currently.

## Next

Task 1.14 POC Checkpoint - E2E validation

## Task 1.13 Implementation Notes
- Imported buildGmailSearchString and buildOutlookSearchString from ./email-search
- Enhanced notes to include email metadata: senderName, senderEmail, emailDate (human-readable), emailSubject, accountEmail (Gmail only)
- Added search string based on email client (Gmail vs Outlook detection via pageUrl)
- Metadata only added when state.contentType === 'email'
- Date formatted using toLocaleDateString for human readability
- Search string formatted as "Search in [Gmail/Outlook]:\n{search_string}"

## Task Planning Discoveries

- **31 total tasks**: Phase 1 (14 POC), Phase 2 (6 refactoring), Phase 3 (8 testing), Phase 4 (3 quality gates)
- **Quality checkpoints**: Inserted every 2-3 tasks throughout all phases for early issue detection
- **E2E validation in POC**: Task 1.14 requires manual browser testing with built extension
- **Key dependency chain**: types -> API -> service worker -> popup wiring
- **Parallel loading**: Users and projects load simultaneously on workspace change
- **Date format complexity**: Gmail uses YYYY/MM/DD, Outlook uses M/D/YYYY - handled in email-search.ts
- **Backward compatibility**: Keep existing emailSender field while adding new senderName/senderEmail

## Design Phase Discoveries

- **Parallel loading opportunity**: Users and projects can load simultaneously on workspace change
- **Backward compatibility needed**: Existing `emailSender` field must remain for compat, add new `senderName`/`senderEmail`
- **Time picker complexity**: Separate checkbox + time input simpler than combined datetime picker
- **Search string in notes**: Cleaner than separate field, matches user request
- **Due date not persisted**: User only requested assignee persistence, due date resets each session
- **getCurrentUser() needed**: For "me" default, use Asana's `/users/me` endpoint
- **Type union extension**: GET_USERS follows existing ExtensionMessage pattern exactly
- **Cache key pattern**: `CACHE_KEYS.USERS(workspaceGid)` matches existing projects/tags pattern

### Verification: 1.4 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: types and API
- Status: PASS
- Commands: pnpm lint (exit 0), pnpm check-types (exit 0)
- No fixes needed - all checks passed on first run

### Task 1.12 Implementation Notes
- Added DOM element references for assigneeSelect, dueDateInput, btnToday, btnTomorrow, includeTimeCheckbox, dueTimeInput
- Extended PopupLocalState with users, currentUserGid, selectedAssigneeGid, dueDate, dueTime, senderName, senderEmail, emailDate
- Created loadUsers() function following loadProjects pattern
- Created populateAssigneeDropdown() and resetAssigneeDropdown() functions
- Users now load in parallel with projects on workspace change (Promise.all)
- Today/Tomorrow buttons set date using toISOString().split('T')[0]
- Include time checkbox enables/disables time input
- handleSubmitTask includes assignee, due_on/due_at in payload
- saveLastUsedSelections includes assigneeGid for persistence
- Note: currentUserGid defaulting infrastructure is in place but requires GET_CURRENT_USER message type/handler which was not part of this task's scope (types.ts and service-worker.ts are out of scope)
